# Nyarly's public git-along configs

`git-along` is a tool
to accomplish something like
what a dotfile repo would,
but for software workspaces.
The idea  is that
there's configuration
idiosyncratic to each developer,
and that clutters the source code
if included,
but it is useful to
version control separately.

For instance, so share between machines,
or reuse across similar projects,
or share with colleagues.

Note that `git-along`
stores its files in branches,
so there's far more going on here
than is immediately apparent.
